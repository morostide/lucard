                hi sorry for the bare page i will set up something properly soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                welcome to my site.
            </p>

            <ul>i am aspho:

                <li>asian</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>i am a:
                <li>victorian vampire puppet/doll... yeah i know... thats a lot...</li>
                <li>elf (if you imagine the ffxiv elezen)</li>
                <li>ungulate (mainly cervids, and equines)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                i love medieval, rennaisance, victorian, and 1970s era history, culture and fashion. learning about
                mythology and religions across the world also greatly interests me. i really love tea and coffee, i
                alternate between my obsession with the two but almost never stop
                drinking either
            </p>

            <p>
                i'm a diehard for celebrating halloween, visiting pumpkin patches, haunted houses and farms with haunted
                attractions. my favorite halloween creatures are <b>vampires and headless horsemen / dullahan</b>. i
                want to
                collect lots
                of headless horseman merch from <a href="https://headlesshorsemangifts.com/">sleepy hollow</a> and read
                & watch as many sleepy hollow, etc. related media as i can. which is a manageable goal because with
                vampire media in comparison... i think theres too much for me to keep up with
            </p>

            <p>i have been drawing for about 12 years as a hobby. just recently at the end of 2022, i began to learn to
                sew and now would like to make plushies, quilts, and other assorted things. and in late 2023 i was
                inspired to make my own low-poly 3d models. and now, at the end of 2023... i want to do simple code!
