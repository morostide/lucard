                hi sorry for the bare page i will set up something properly soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                welcome to my site. about me...
            </p>

            <ul>i am aspho:
                <li>26 years old</li>
                <li>it/its and he/him</li>
                <li>transgender man</li>
                <li>bisexual</li>
                <li>asian</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>i am a:
                <li>victorian vampire elf puppet/doll... yeah i know... that a lot...</li>
                <li>i specifically relate to <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Elezen">ffxiv elezen</a> & <a
                        href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Elvaan">ffxi elvaan</a> just literally imagine me as
                    one</li>
                <li>ungulate (cervids and equines)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                imagine some shy thin man with long black hair + metal rimmed glasses + shadows under eyes
                + pointed ears +
                fangs + a frilly shirt
                etc. thats me... i have fursonas i'll set up pages for later as well. pics of things i relate to are
                below, if they help you have a mental image of me
            </p>

            <p>
                i love medieval, rennaisance, victorian, and 1970s era history, culture and fashion. learning about
                mythology and religions across the world also greatly interests me. i really love tea and coffee; i
                alternate between my obsession with the two, but almost never stop drinking either
            </p>

            <p>
                i'm a diehard for celebrating halloween, visiting pumpkin patches, haunted houses and farms with haunted
                attractions. my favorite halloween creatures are <b>vampires and headless horsemen / dullahan</b>
            </p>

            <p>i am also extremely passionate about the castlevania games (not netflix), and have watched playthroughs
                of them in
                chronological order
                up until Order of Ecclesia (which i need to start watching); so i am familiar with all of the characters
                before Ecclesia. Curse of Darkness is my favorite castlevania game and i am extremely attached to it; I
                really love Isaac and Hector.
            </p>


            <p>i have been drawing for about 12 years as a hobby. just recently at the end of 2022, i began to learn to
                sew and now would like to make plushies, quilts, and other assorted things. and in late 2023 i was
                inspired to make my own low-poly 3d models. and now, at the end of 2023... i want to do simple code! i
                will share my art here once i make the appropriate pages.
            </p>

            <p>i named myself <b>Aspho</b> after my elezen oc i created this year, who took his name from FFXIV's
                "Asphodelos"
                from
                "Pandaemonium"
                (contains FFXIV story
                spoilers, please don't look it up if you'rehaven't completed Endwalker
                Patch 6.0). if you ever see me
                refer to "aspho" in 3rd person, i am exclusively talking about my oc; not myself
            </p>

            <p>^ <i>pictures of my oc Aspho. im really addicted to him</i></p>
            <p> (he/him transmasc woman. *here i only call him a woman for clarity on his gender, but all other times
                he's addressed as "male/man/etc") he is important to me in that reflects a lot of my
                interests and aspects of myself i currently project on, or used to relate to in the past, but he's not
                directly representative of me like a sona. ok back to talking about myself</p>

                <b>ABOUT THIS SITE</b>
            </p>

            <p><b>why is my url lucard:</b> i began to use the online username Lucard initially not because of alucard
                from castlevania (though i
                love him)
                but because of the kotodummy <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/KotodamaD/status/1719520793133215979">Lucard</a> from Kotodama diary. but
                then the name instantly brought me back to my attachment for Alucard, so...</p>
            <p><b>why did you join neocities:</b> same story as everyone else here "im sick of and cynical about modern
                social media" "i want a place to freely express myself without limitations" "i want to make a place
                online that feels like "home"" etc</p>
            <p><b>what is your coding experience:</b> surprisingly very little. i've done extremely simplistic code
                before (enough to make a box and center text in it). in 2019, i took an intro to webdev class that gave
                me some basic coding skills, but being miserable maintaining a grade and having to code for a high
                pressure group project didn't ignite my passion
                for making websites. it was only at the end of 2023 that i felt like making a website was the best
                option for me</p>
