                hi sorry for the bare page i will set up something properly soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                welcome to my site. about me...
            </p>

            <ul>i am aspho:
                <li>26 years old</li>
                <li>it/its and he/him</li>
                <li>transgender man</li>
                <li>bisexual</li>
                <li>asian</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>i am a:
                <li>victorian vampire puppet/doll... yeah i know... that a lot...</li>
                <li>elf (i specifically relate to ffxiv elezen & ffxi elvaan)</li>
                <li>headless horseman</li>
                <li>ungulate (cervids and equines)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                if you imagine some shy thin frail man with long black hair, metal rimmed glasses, a frilly shirt etc.
                thats me... i have some fursonas i'll set up pages for later, too
            </p>

            <p>
                i love medieval, rennaisance, victorian, and 1970s era history, culture and fashion. learning about
                mythology and religions across the world also greatly interests me. i really love tea and coffee; i
                alternate between my obsession with the two, but almost never stop drinking either
            </p>

            <p>
                i'm a diehard for celebrating halloween, visiting pumpkin patches, haunted houses and farms with haunted
                attractions. my favorite halloween creatures are <b>vampires and headless horsemen / dullahan</b>.
                because theyre cool and relatable to me somehow
            </p>

            <p>i have been drawing for about 12 years as a hobby. just recently at the end of 2022, i began to learn to
                sew and now would like to make plushies, quilts, and other assorted things. and in late 2023 i was
                inspired to make my own low-poly 3d models. and now, at the end of 2023... i want to do simple code! i
                will share my art here once i make the appropriate pages.

                <b>ABOUT THIS SITE</b>
            </p>

            <p><b>why is my url lucard:</b> i began to use the online username Lucard initially not because of alucard
                from castlevania (though i
                love him)
                but because of the kotodummy <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/KotodamaD/status/1719520793133215979">Lucard</a> from Kotodama diary. but
                then the name instantly brought me back to my attachment for Alucard, so...</p>
            <p><b>why did you join neocities:</b> as far back as 2019, i began to feel pessimistic about how fast-paced,
                sanitized and shallow modern corporate-owned social media felt;
                but it wasnt until 2022 when a very specific white billionare took over a very specific website that i
                finally just stopped and left. joined
                neocities to get away from that, because i sincerely believe in how important it is for self expression
                to get away from corporate and having full control over . the same story a lot of other people on
                neocities have had</p>
            <p><b>what is your coding experience:</b> surprisingly very little. i've done extremely simplistic code
                before (enough to make a box and center text in it). in 2019, i took an intro to webdev class that gave
                me some basic coding skills, but being miserable maintaining a grade and having to code for a high
                pressure group project didn't ignite my passion
                for making websites. it was only at the end of 2023 that i got sick of modern social media, left, and
                felt creatively challenged to make a place online that felt like truly felt like an online "home" for
                the first time</p>
